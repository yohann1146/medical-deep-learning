# End-to-end Deep Learning Model for Semantic Segmentation of Medical Imaging
This project aims to create a deep learning pipeling to analyze and classify medical images, by training on a brain tumor segmentation dataset.

## Structure
**/env/**: contains list libraries/frameworks required
**/data/**: contains both raw image data and the sliced (3d to 2d) matrices for processing
**/src/**: contains source code for the TF model, OpenCV processing, importing datasets and other miscellaneous utilities.

## Pending
Deployment on Jetson Nano
OpenCV Augmentation
Loading of datasets
